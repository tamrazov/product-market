This spa was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Reactjs** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. I`m gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Reactjs** community **styleguides & best practices.**

In this application you can see how I use the component system, router, store and many of my knowledge of this technology, however this project does not fully reflect my knowledge of all web programming. I would also like you to look at my other projects.
